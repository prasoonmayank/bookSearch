# bookSearch

Using the BRISK feature detector algorithm for detecting features and matching the book cover of the query image with the database.
BRISK uses the hamming distance for comparision. Although, there is an option to use the SIFT feature detector in place of BRISK detector, in which case we use the Euclidean distance rather than the Hamming distance for the same task.
